[I2C Framework Expansion Card](https://medo64.com/i2cframecard/)
================================================================

This Framework laptop expansion card will show up on your system as a serial
device and allow for a non-isolated 3.3V I2C operation up to 400 kHz.


## Pinout

| # | Ref | Description                     |
|--:|-----|---------------------------------|
| 1 | SDA | I2C data (3.3V)                 |
| 2 | GND | Ground connection               |
| 3 | SCL | I2C clock (3.3V)                |
| 4 | V+  | 3.3V output (200 mA)            |


### Wiring

To connect to this board, one has to use a 4-pin JST XH connector, pin 1 being
on the left as looking into the expansion card.

I would recommend using at least 24 AWG wire 0.25 mmÂ² as they allow for
greater compatibility with other connectors.
